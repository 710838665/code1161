I remmber some code model i think it will help me a lot.
TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
def some+function():
    count = 0
    While true:
        if count < 10:
            count += 1
        else
            return count
return_value = some_function()
print(return_value)

def some_function()

    while True:
        x = input("give me somthings")
        print(x)
        if x == "exit!":
            return x
some_function()
 while True:

        number = not_number_rejector('Please enter a number: ')

        if low < number and number < high:

            break

    return number
    I know that we can use the not_mumber_rejector to determine the words and number.
    then i always know some things to creative a little game,but i am not sure is that working.
    And the week3 exercises are very difficult, i have many questions about that. I also do the search on the google but no answer fit them.
I kown that 
"="mean c = a + b 
+=mean
c += a equal c = c + a
-=mean
c -= a equal c = c - a
*=mean
c *= a equalc = c * a
/=mean
c /= a equal c = c / a
%=mean
c %= a equal c = c % a
**=mean
c **= a equal c = c ** a
//=mean
c //= a equal c = c // a
