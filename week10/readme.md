TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learned machine learning exercises this week, but I encountered some problems after installing the software. My laptop was removed from the factory with the cpu integrated graphics function, so some softwares that need to be set to work cannot be run. Then I learned a lot of code for installing programs like pip pip3 conda. And some code to run the program. In short, it fully demonstrates the power of Python in real life.
In the beginning of the Open Data project,I have a lot of questions about how to deal with integrating data in upyter labbook, but the kaggle tutorial helps me a lot.
I am still thinking about which data set to choose and apply it.
I hope I can make more progress in the next tutorial.
