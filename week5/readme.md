TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I learned how to set a range or the condition for while loop,
this will determin when it becomes false i now have a better understanding of if/else and how to combine multiple commands.
And I also learned that how to add url into the code. 
But I don"t kmow some things,so that some exercises didn't work.I think i will find it out.
such like the: " square_koch(t, order, size)"\ "wordy_pyramid():"\get_a_word_of_length_n(length)"
i think this week exercise is super difficult and i learned how to calculate triangles area and perimeter and aspect.And i will study again and slove the problems.
