TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I week11 we learned how to find information.I selected a database of interest from https://www.kaggle.com/ and presented a problem I wanted to solve.
After that we learned something about panda and matplotlib.
So that could help me collect different data from different situations.
